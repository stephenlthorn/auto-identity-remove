# auto-identity-remove

Automated data broker opt-out runner for macOS. Removes your personal information from **500+ people-search sites and data broker databases** on a monthly schedule — with CAPTCHA solving, persistent state tracking (so completed opt-outs aren't resubmitted every run), and an iMessage notification when done.

## What it does

Each month, the script:

1. **Searches** each data broker site for your name + state
2. **Finds your specific listing** (for sites that need a profile URL)
3. **Fills and submits** the opt-out form automatically
4. **Solves CAPTCHAs** via [CapSolver](https://capsolver.com) (AI-powered, ~$0.001/solve)
5. **Skips** brokers you were already removed from recently (90-day re-check window)
6. **Sends you an iMessage** with the results summary
7. **Opens** any sites that require manual action in your browser

---

## Requirements

- macOS (uses launchd for scheduling and Messages for iMessage)
- Node.js 18+
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) browsers installed

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove.git
cd auto-identity-remove

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run interactive setup (creates config.json and schedules the monthly job)
node setup.js

# 4. Run manually anytime
./run.sh
```

## Setup walkthrough

`node setup.js` guides you through:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Personal info** | Name, city, state, ZIP, email, phone |
| **Aliases** | Past names or variations (e.g. "Steve Doe") |
| **CapSolver key** | For CAPTCHA-protected opt-out forms |
| **One-time accounts** | Creates accounts on sites that require login (stored in `config.json`, gitignored) |
| **iMessage** | Phone number to text the results summary to |
| **launchd schedule** | Registers a monthly job to run on the 1st at 9am |

**Your personal info never leaves your machine.** `config.json` and `state.json` are both gitignored.

---

## CapSolver (optional but recommended)

Some opt-out forms have reCAPTCHA. Without CapSolver, those sites go to your manual list instead of being handled automatically.

1. Sign up at [capsolver.com](https://capsolver.com) — free, pay-as-you-go
2. Add $1–2 of credits (enough for months of use at ~$0.001/solve)
3. Paste your API key when `setup.js` asks, or add it to `config.json`:

```json
"capsolver": {
  "apiKey": "CAP-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## State tracking

`state.json` tracks when each broker was last successfully opted out. The default re-check window is **90 days** — brokers typically re-add your data within that window, so the script re-submits when it's time.

```json
{
  "optOuts": {
    "Spokeo": {
      "lastSuccess": "2026-05-01T09:00:00.000Z",
      "totalRuns": 3,
      "detail": ""
    }
  }
}
```

On each run you'll see:
- `✅ Removed` — opt-out submitted this run
- `⏭  Skipped (fresh)` — removed recently, re-check not due yet
- `🔍 Not listed` — your name wasn't found on that site
- `📋 Manual needed` — opened in your browser for you to handle
- `❌ Error` — network/timeout issue, will retry next run

---

### Generic — 500+ additional brokers (auto-detected)

`generic-runner.js` handles the remaining ~470 brokers from two public datasets:

| Dataset | Source | Count |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [The Markup's data broker list](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/01/26/which-data-brokers-offer-opt-outs) | Journalism research, 494 opt-out URLs | ~494 |
| [BADBOOL](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) | Community-maintained people-search list | ~27 extra |

For each site it tries four strategies in order:
1. Click a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" button
2. Opt out via OneTrust / TrustArc / Osano privacy manager
3. Fill any generic opt-out form (email, name, state) and submit
4. Find and record a DSAR / data request link for manual follow-up

Sites requiring manual action are opened in your browser automatically.

### Manual (opened in browser for you)

| Site | Why manual |
|------|-----------|
| Google — Results About You | Requires Google account interaction |
| Google — Outdated Content | Case-by-case URL submission |

## Adding more brokers

Edit `brokers.js` and add an entry:

```js
{
  name: 'NewBrokerSite',
  method: 'direct-form',           // or 'search-form', 'email', 'manual'
  optOutUrl: 'https://example.com/opt-out',
  formFields: {
    'input[name*="first" i]': F,   // F, L, N, E, ST, Z are from config
    'input[name*="last"  i]': L,
    'input[type="email"]':    E,
  },
  submitSelector: 'button[type="submit"]',
  captchaLikely: false,
  priority: 2,
}
```

PRs welcome — especially for brokers with verified working selectors.

---

## Manual run

```bash
./run.sh
```

**Dry-run mode** — navigates to each site and fills forms but does NOT submit anything. Good for verifying what the script will do before your first real run:

```bash
node watcher.js --dry-run
```

Or to run in the background and log output:

```bash
./run.sh >> logs/manual-run.log 2>&1 &
```

### Verifying removals (`--verify`)

Run a read-only spot-check to see whether previous opt-outs are still in effect:

```bash
node watcher.js --verify
```

This opens a browser, searches each broker where you have a recorded successful opt-out, and reports what it finds. No forms are submitted, nothing is written to `state.json`.

Output is grouped into three sections:

| Section | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `VERIFIED CLEAR` | Your name was not found in the broker's search today |
| `STILL LISTED` | A listing was found — the opt-out may have failed, or your data was re-added |
| `UNVERIFIABLE` | The broker uses a direct-form, email, or manual method — no automated search signal exists to check |

A dated JSON report is saved to `logs/verify-YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

**Important caveats:**

- Only `search-form` brokers (those with a `searchUrl` and `listingPattern`) can be checked automatically. Direct-form and email opt-outs are always `unverifiable`.
- "Verified clear" means your name was not found in one search today. It is **not** a legal guarantee of deletion. Brokers routinely re-ingest data from upstream sources.
- "Still listed" can mean the opt-out failed **or** the broker re-added your data since the last successful opt-out was recorded. Either way, re-running `node watcher.js` will attempt removal again.
- If the broker's search page is down or slow, the result is classified as `unverifiable` (a timeout is not counted as "still listed").

## Maintenance

### Pruning stale / dead URLs

The Markup dataset is years old; many of the ~489 generic opt-out URLs now 404 or fail DNS lookup. These are classified as `💀 Dead (stale URL)` in run output and do **not** count as errors.

After several runs have accumulated in `logs/`, trim permanently-dead hostnames from future runs so they are skipped without any network request:

```bash
node scripts/prune-dead.js
```

The script:
1. Reads every `logs/run-*.json` file
2. Finds hostnames whose status was `dead` in **every** run they appeared in
3. Merges them into `data/dead-urls.json` (deduped, sorted)
4. Prints a summary of how many new hosts were added

The script is **idempotent** — running it twice produces no change. You can add it as a post-run step or run it manually whenever you want to prune the dead list.

`data/dead-urls.json` is committed to the repo so the dead list is shared with all clones.

## Uninstall / disable schedule

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.auto-identity-remove.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.auto-identity-remove.plist
```

## Is it safe to submit my info to 500 opt-out forms?

A fair concern raised by some users: aren't you just confirming your data to the brokers by filling out their forms?

A few things worth knowing:

- **These brokers already have your info.** You're not revealing anything new — you're using the legally-required removal mechanism they're obligated to provide.
- **CCPA (California) and similar state laws require brokers to honor opt-out requests.** Submitting the form creates a legal obligation to remove you. Doing nothing does not.
- **The script uses info you're already listed under** — your name as it appears publicly, your state, your email. It doesn't add new data points.
- **The alternative is worse.** Every month that passes, more brokers scrape and resell your data. Opt-outs are imperfect, but they work more often than not.

That said: if you're in a situation where even confirming your email address to a broker is a risk, this tool is not the right approach. Consider a paid service that uses a proxy email.

## California residents: DELETE Registry (August 2025)

California is launching an official **Delete Me** opt-out registry on August 1, 2025. Once registered, data brokers are legally required to delete your info automatically — no individual form submissions needed for participating brokers.

Register at: **[optoutregistry.oag.ca.gov](https://optoutregistry.oag.ca.gov)** (live August 1)

**Recommended:** Register with the CA Delete Registry first, then run this script for the brokers that aren't covered.

---

## Why not just use a paid service?

Paid services like [Incogni](https://incogni.com) ($96/yr) or [Optery](https://optery.com) ($39/yr) are excellent and cover more brokers with professionally maintained opt-out flows. This tool is for people who want full control, transparency, and no recurring subscription — or who want to handle the gaps those services miss (Acxiom, LexisNexis, ZoomInfo, Clearbit).

Using both is the strongest approach: a paid service for the bulk of brokers + this script for the gaps.
