# auto-identity-remove

Automated data broker opt-out runner for macOS. Removes your personal information from 30+ people-search sites and data broker databases on a monthly schedule — with CAPTCHA solving, persistent state tracking (so completed opt-outs aren't resubmitted every run), and an iMessage notification when done.

## What it does

Each month, the script:

1. **Searches** each data broker site for your name + state
2. **Finds your specific listing** (for sites that need a profile URL)
3. **Fills and submits** the opt-out form automatically
4. **Solves CAPTCHAs** via [CapSolver](https://capsolver.com) (AI-powered, ~$0.001/solve)
5. **Skips** brokers you were already removed from recently (90-day re-check window)
6. **Sends you an iMessage** with the results summary
7. **Opens** any sites that require manual action in your browser

---

## Requirements

- macOS (uses launchd for scheduling and Messages for iMessage)
- Node.js 18+
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) browsers installed

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/stephenlthorn/auto-identity-remove.git
cd auto-identity-remove

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run interactive setup (creates config.json and schedules the monthly job)
node setup.js

# 4. Run manually anytime
./run.sh
```

## Setup walkthrough

`node setup.js` guides you through:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Personal info** | Name, city, state, ZIP, email, phone |
| **Aliases** | Past names or variations (e.g. "Steve Doe") |
| **CapSolver key** | For CAPTCHA-protected opt-out forms |
| **One-time accounts** | Creates accounts on sites that require login (stored in `config.json`, gitignored) |
| **iMessage** | Phone number to text the results summary to |
| **launchd schedule** | Registers a monthly job to run on the 1st at 9am |

**Your personal info never leaves your machine.** `config.json` and `state.json` are both gitignored.

---

## CapSolver (optional but recommended)

Some opt-out forms have reCAPTCHA. Without CapSolver, those sites go to your manual list instead of being handled automatically.

1. Sign up at [capsolver.com](https://capsolver.com) — free, pay-as-you-go
2. Add $1–2 of credits (enough for months of use at ~$0.001/solve)
3. Paste your API key when `setup.js` asks, or add it to `config.json`:

```json
"capsolver": {
  "apiKey": "CAP-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## State tracking

`state.json` tracks when each broker was last successfully opted out. The default re-check window is **90 days** — brokers typically re-add your data within that window, so the script re-submits when it's time.

```json
{
  "optOuts": {
    "Spokeo": {
      "lastSuccess": "2026-05-01T09:00:00.000Z",
      "totalRuns": 3,
      "detail": ""
    }
  }
}
```

On each run you'll see:
- `✅ Removed` — opt-out submitted this run
- `⏭  Skipped (fresh)` — removed recently, re-check not due yet
- `🔍 Not listed` — your name wasn't found on that site
- `📋 Manual needed` — opened in your browser for you to handle
- `❌ Error` — network/timeout issue, will retry next run

## Adding more brokers

Edit `brokers.js` and add an entry:

```js
{
  name: 'NewBrokerSite',
  method: 'direct-form',           // or 'search-form', 'email', 'manual'
  optOutUrl: 'https://example.com/opt-out',
  formFields: {
    'input[name*="first" i]': F,   // F, L, N, E, ST, Z are from config
    'input[name*="last"  i]': L,
    'input[type="email"]':    E,
  },
  submitSelector: 'button[type="submit"]',
  captchaLikely: false,
  priority: 2,
}
```

PRs welcome — especially for brokers with verified working selectors.

## Manual run

```bash
./run.sh
```

Or to run in the background and log output:

```bash
./run.sh >> logs/manual-run.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## Uninstall / disable schedule

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.auto-identity-remove.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.auto-identity-remove.plist
```

## Why not just use a paid service?

Paid services like [Incogni](https://incogni.com) ($96/yr) or [Optery](https://optery.com) ($39/yr) are excellent and cover more brokers with professionally maintained opt-out flows. This tool is for people who want full control, transparency, and no recurring subscription — or who want to handle the gaps those services miss (Acxiom, LexisNexis, ZoomInfo, Clearbit).

Using both is the strongest approach: a paid service for the bulk of brokers + this script for the gaps.
